# Open Community License (OCL)

This repository contains the Open Community License (OCL v1) - a license designed to allow open access to community including the essential right, the right-to-repair, while promoting fair competition.

## License

OCL pertains to intellectual property applied in the licensor’s products and/or its components (hardware and software) which is distributed under such, including copyright, design, and patent.

All licensor’s copyrights, designs, and patents as far as relevant to products and/or its components under OCL are community open. The aim of OCL is to allow open access to the community, including the essential **right-to-repair**, by giving users complete freedom of use, copy, modification, and hacking, while promoting fair competition by securing intellectual property rights to prevent vendor locking and patent trolling.

**Note:** Any part of the product and/or its component provided under a license incompatible with OCL remains unaffected by OCL.

### 2. As a Non-Commercial END USER

* **YOU MAY** use, copy, modify, and hack the product and/or its components as you wish!

* **YOU SHOULD** support the 3D printing community by sharing your creations and modifications.

* **YOU MUST**, if you distribute your creations, modifications, or any such derivatives, do so under OCL or any non-commercial, share-alike license allowing other community members to do everything that YOU MAY. This does not concern your creations and modifications that are not derived from the product and/or its components.

### 3. As a Commercial BUSINESS USER

* **YOU MAY** use the product and modify it for your use case solely for your internal production use.

* **YOU MUST NOT** modify the product and/or its components for any commercial purpose other than your internal production use.

* **YOU MUST NOT** copy or in any way replicate the product and/or its components for any commercial purpose (excluding your internal right-to-repair) without obtaining a separate business license or repair license.

### 4. General Provisions

Licensor’s products and/or its components under OCL **MUST NOT** be subject to any systematic or automated text and/or data mining or other text and/or data collection activity in relation to the product without explicit permission.

To promote ease of understanding of OCL, the Licensor keeps and updates a database of products and/or its components licensed under OCL and good practices.
